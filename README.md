<strong>
Oops, this code is not meant to be readeble to other humans, but give it a try if you want to
</strong><br>

An application that creates voxel models from other models.
<br>
The application can take everything that the assimp library can take (2024) https://github.com/assimp/assimp, but not the ownFileType for the engine.
<br>
The engine is my own created with DirectX 12 (Sorry Linux and Mac users)
<br>

<strong>Move with WASD, Shift(Down), Space(up) and CTRL(faster speed).</strong>
<br>
also use mouse click to interact with IMGUI elements.
<br>
(Tab can also be used to get the objects position, size and rotation, and will stop the mouse rotation on the camera! Press Tab again to remove it)
<br>
<strong>The Important files that tackels the problem is: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>FBXToVoxel/ModelToVoxel.h/.cpp</li>
  <li>FBXToVoxel/ComputeVoxels.hlsl (Not recommended)</li>
</ul>
